# REASON I Made This Project

I wanted to learn how to connect to an api because I never done it before so I wanted to create a project that would make me use an API while also doing on a topic I enjoy which is Anime.

# Technical Difficulty I Had.

There were two things that got in my way at the beginning when I first started this project.
1)The Jikan Api itself was going through a new version migration. At that time I was using V3 while V4 was being flesh out.
