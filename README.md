# REASON I Made This Project

I wanted to learn how to connect to an api because I never done it before so I wanted to create a project that would make me use an API while also doing on a topic I enjoy which is Anime.

# Technical Difficulty I Had.

There were two things that got in my way at the beginning when I first started this project.

1)The Jikan Api itself was going through a new version migration. At that time I was using V3 while V4 was being flesh out. I did not think it would matter but my app stopped working after 2 days. It was completely working before but since I was using the old version, It was to be expected. Then I migrated everything to V4 and It work again. The lesson that I learned is to use the newest version if possible.

2)It is how to use the Api itself. I know there are at least two ways to use an API. one is using the link and call it from the frontend. The other is getting an API key and connecting it through the backend. I went and did the former where I used the API link. The querying of the link took some time getting use to. Making sure I got the sytanx in the correct format. Also the documentation for the new version was different from the old version so it took some time figuring it out. After some perservance I got it to work the way I wanted it to.
